A 2D platformer game built in Unity for **Saskatoon Game Jam 2025** (Sep 26-28). Created around the theme **"Bring the Heat"**, this game retells the ancient Greek myth of Prometheus, who dared to steal fire from the gods to give to humanity.

## Game Overview

**Promethean Heat** is a 2D side-scrolling platformer that follows the legendary tale of Prometheus on his quest to bring fire to humanity. Players journey through the three realms of Greek mythology, battling gods and collecting flame embers in a race against divine wrath. The game features character movement mechanics, animated enemies, and multiple interconnected levels with distinct mythological themes.

## The Myth of Prometheus

In ancient Greek mythology, Prometheus was a Titan who defied Zeus by stealing fire from Mount Olympus and giving it to humanity. This act of rebellion brought knowledge, warmth, and civilization to mortals, but also earned him the eternal wrath of the gods. Our game reimagines this classic tale as an epic platforming adventure through the three divine realms.

## The Journey Through Three Realms

### **Underworld - Hades' Domain**
Prometheus begins his quest in the depths of the Underworld, navigating through Hades' dark caverns and lava-filled chambers. Here he must collect **Shining Pieces** (flame embers) while avoiding the dangers of the realm of the dead. Once enough embers are gathered, he faces **Hades** himself in an epic boss battle to escape the underworld.

### **Underwater - Poseidon's Ocean**
After defeating Hades, Prometheus finds himself in Poseidon's underwater domain. Swimming through bubble-filled depths and ancient temples, he continues collecting Shining Pieces while navigating the treacherous waters. The journey culminates in a fierce battle against **Poseidon**, god of the seas.

### **Overworld - Mount Olympus & Zeus**
The final realm takes Prometheus to the surface world and up the mighty Mount Olympus. Climbing through caves and reaching the peak of the gods' dwelling, he prepares for the ultimate confrontation. At the summit, he faces **Zeus**, king of the gods, in the final battle to steal the divine flame and bring it back to humanity.
